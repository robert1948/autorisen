# The marketplace (preview)
The marketplace is where agents become discoverable.
Not everything here is active yet. That’s intentional.
When complete, you’ll be able to:
- Explore agents without installing them
- See what they do before trusting them
- Understand permissions before enabling anything
Published agents are reviewed.
Draft agents remain private.
Archived agents leave quietly.
Discovery comes before commitment.
