# Start here
CapeControl is not in a hurry.
It doesn’t begin by asking you to sign up, configure settings, or learn new jargon.
It begins by offering one useful thing—and then letting the next question appear.
This space is here for quiet exploration.
You can read, skim, or stop at any point.
Nothing will break.
Nothing will follow you.
Nothing will ask for commitment.
If something feels interesting, you can continue.
If not, that’s fine too.
This is the calm before power.
