# Agents, simply explained
An agent is not a chatbot. It’s not a script. It’s not magic.
An agent is a focused helper with:
- A clear purpose
- Defined boundaries
- Explicit permissions
Some agents guide. Some observe. Some automate small, careful tasks.
They don’t act unless invited. They don’t see what they aren’t allowed to see.
You can use one agent—or many.
You can pause them. You can remove them.
Nothing runs without consent.
