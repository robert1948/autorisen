# Trust & safety
Trust is not a feature. It’s a feeling that develops when nothing unexpected happens.
When you browse quietly:
- No account is created
- No data is stored
- No tracking follows you across pages
When you do choose to sign in:
- Your data remains yours
- Access is explicit and reversible
- Boundaries are clear
CapeControl is designed to be useful without being invasive.
You stay in control—always.
