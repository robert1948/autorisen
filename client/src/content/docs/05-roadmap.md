# What’s coming (and what isn’t)
CapeControl grows carefully.
What’s coming:
- Deeper agent previews
- Guided onboarding (optional)
- Clear usage insights
- More ways to explore quietly
What’s not coming:
- Forced upgrades
- Dark patterns
- Sudden paywalls
- Urgency for its own sake
Progress here is deliberate.
You’ll always have time to decide.
