# The Curiosity Trail
Most software demands decisions upfront. CapeControl does the opposite.
Instead of funnels, it uses a trail.
Each step reveals just enough to be useful.
Each choice keeps the next one optional.
You may notice small prompts, subtle invitations, or gentle progress markers.
They are not tasks. They are breadcrumbs.
You can follow them. You can ignore them. You can come back later.
The system adapts to curiosity—not pressure.
