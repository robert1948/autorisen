# Archive Index — 2026-02-02

## Why
Repo hygiene: move non-active artifacts out of the working set while preserving history.

## Rules
- No deletions in this pass (move only).
- Anything referenced by SYSTEM_SPEC / project-plan / active code stays in place.
- Each moved item should have a short reason.

## Moved items
- `archive/2026-02-02/index copy.css` — Duplicate stylesheet copy; not referenced by active code/docs.
- `docs/archive/2026-02-02/project-plan-backup-20251108.csv` — Historical backup of the plan; SSOT is `docs/project-plan.csv`.
