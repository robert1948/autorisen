### Customization Notes

1. **Jurisdiction**: Replace \[Your Jurisdiction\] with your country/state (e.g., "California, USA"). Consult a lawyer to ensure compliance with local laws.  
2. **IP Terms**: Decide whether to grant full ownership or a license for Deliverables. Full ownership may require higher fees.  
3. **Payment Terms**: Adjust the payment schedule (e.g., 50% upfront) and late fee rates based on your business model.  
4. **Warranty Period**: Modify the warranty period (e.g., 30 days) to suit your services.  
5. **Dispute Resolution**: Choose arbitration, mediation, or litigation based on your preference and legal advice.  
6. **Cancellation Fees**: Adjust fees (e.g., 20%) based on your financial model.

### Implementation Tips

- **Format**: Provide this as a PDF or web page linked in your Proposal, with a checkbox or e-signature field for acceptance.  
- **Clarity**: Include a one-page summary of key terms (e.g., payment, IP, termination) for customer convenience.  
- **Legal Review**: Have a lawyer review the T\&Cs to ensure enforceability, especially for data privacy (e.g., GDPR for EU customers) and IP rights.  
- **Integration**: Embed T\&Cs in your e-signature tool (e.g., DocuSign) during Step 2 of customer onboarding (Proposal and Agreement).
