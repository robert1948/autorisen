### 1. Purpose

This document formally declares the acceptance of the **CapeControl Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**.

* a coherent product philosophy,
* a trustworthy user experience,
* and a stable foundation for controlled growth.

### 2. MVP Definition

For CapeControl, an acceptable MVP is defined as a system that:

* Delivers **one clear, end-to-end user journey**
* Makes **only promises it can keep**
* Clearly distinguishes between:

  * what is production-ready,
  * what is experimental,
  * and what is intentionally not yet available
* Demonstrates thoughtful governance, security awareness, and technical discipline

The MVP prioritizes **credibility over breadth**.

### 3. Accepted Golden Path

The following user journey is fully implemented, verified, and accepted:

1. User arrives on the landing page
2. Value proposition is understandable within seconds
3. A clear call-to-action invites exploration or registration
4. User can register successfully
5. User is authenticated and routed correctly
6. Onboarding begins immediately and intentionally
7. User reaches a clear “I’m in the system” moment

This path functions without dead ends, misleading affordances, or broken expectations.

### 4. Explicit Non-Goals of This MVP

The following are **intentionally excluded** from MVP acceptance criteria:

* Feature completeness
* Multiple dashboards or agent types

* Stable authentication flows
* Predictable routing and error handling
* Environment separation (staging vs production)
