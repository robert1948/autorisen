## How to use these personas

- Use persona JTBDs to prioritise feature development and create sample starter prompts in `GET /api/examples`.
- Ensure onboarding flows include persona selection and pre-filled starter tasks.

## Next steps

- Add quantitative measures and sample users for each persona.
- Validate personas with at least 3 external interviews per persona.
