# Codex Playbooks Index

Use these documents to guide Codex-in-VS Code work. Start with `_smoketest.md`.

## Start Here
- `_smoketest.md` — quick “is Codex behaving” checklist

## Roles / Agents
- `CapeAIGuideAgent.md` — planning/governance behavior
- `PlanSyncAgent.md` — plan updates, checklist hygiene, status sync
- `DocCleanAgent.md` — safe documentation-only cleanup tasks
- `TestFrameworkCodex.md` — testing strategy + commands + gating
- `TestGuardianAgent.md` — safety gates, stop conditions, evidence rules
- `AgentDeveloperCodex.md` — building/adjusting agents & prompts
- `MarketPlaceCodex.md` — marketplace-related work (guarded)
- `CiTuneAgent.md` — CI/automation tune-ups (guarded)

## Notes
- Prefer “plan → approve → execute → verify → commit” for all work.
- Keep tasks in `docs/agents/codex-tasks/` with a standard structure.
