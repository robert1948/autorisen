# 🎨 Figma Integration Guide

This directory holds all design-sync artifacts for the **CapeControl / AutoLocal** ecosystem.  
It connects Figma design files to the codebase, docs, and CI/CD checks.

---

## 🧩 Purpose

Keep **visual design**, **frontend implementation**, and **documentation** aligned by:

1. Exporting approved frames directly from Figma via API.  
1. Storing exported assets in version-controlled folders.  
1. Tracking the current approved design version in `version.json`.  
1. Enforcing that version through the GitHub Action `design-check.yml`.
