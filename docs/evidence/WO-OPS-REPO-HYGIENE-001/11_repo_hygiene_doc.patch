+# Repo Hygiene (Autorisen / Staging)
+
+## Purpose
+Keep the autorisen repository small, reproducible, and evidence-first without committing build artifacts, caches, or heavy raw evidence.
+
+## What stays in Git
+- Source code, configs, Dockerfiles, compose files
+- docs/specs and runbooks
+- Evidence packs that are copy/paste-ready summaries:
+  - command lines used
+  - small outputs and pass/fail results
+  - diffs / patches (small text)
+
+## What must NOT be committed
+- Build artifacts: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.vite/`
+- Python caches/venvs: `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.venv/`
+- Logs and runtime output: `*.log`, `logs/`, `tmp/`
+- Secrets: `.env`, keys, tokens, credentials
+- Heavy/raw evidence artifacts:
+  - screenshots, videos, HAR files
+  - DB dumps / large SQL outputs
+
+## Evidence storage rules
+- Git-friendly evidence goes under: `docs/evidence/<WO-ID>/`
+- Heavy/raw artifacts go under: `docs/evidence/_raw/` (ignored by Git)
+
+## Cleanup commands
+- Local cleanup script:
+  - `scripts/clean.sh`
+- Preview what would be removed:
+  - `git clean -nd`  (untracked)
+  - `git clean -ndX` (ignored only)
+
+## Safety
+- This repo is staging/sandbox (autorisen). Do not run production/capecraft commands unless explicitly instructed by Robert.
