- New agents
- New dashboards
- Pricing/monetization work
- Roadmaps
- Architecture changes
- Production deploys/releases (capecraft is not authorized)

## Closure Statement (to be recorded at end of freeze)

> “CapeControl MVP v1 is accepted.
> All future work expands capability, not credibility.”
